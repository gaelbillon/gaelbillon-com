Activities, restaurants, cottages, campsites, cultural sites, sports complexes, news, all the necessary information is accessible from parthenay.myorpheo.com.

### Technique

The application uses the Parthenay API to retrieve XML files for each category, the XML are then transformed into JSON by a proxy. At the first request the application records the results using HTML5's storage API and a very practical plugin developed by Paul Irish.

The results of the queries are displayed in multi-level lists, it was necessary to create a plugin in order not to display the header of jQuery mobile in some sub-lists.

![google maps logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/maps.jpg)All the venues are also accessible from a Google map, there again we retrieve from the cache when possible, the map readjusts its limits each time we add new POIs.  

![facebook logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/facebook_logo_detail.jpg)The facebook API is integrated into the application and allows you to bring a social side to the application by sharing a place, a news or an event.  

![jquery logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/jquery-logo.jpg)Some tools have saved us valuable time, such as jQueryMobile, which facilitates the creation of a mobile interface oriented "Single Page Application".

 

![handlebars logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/handlebars_logo-1.jpg)Handlebars.js, a template engine that automatically builds the HTML of each page according to the JSON you send it.  

![require.js logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/require.jpg)Require.js allows you to no longer worry about script chargging management.  

![coffeescript logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/coffeescript_logo-553d0e0b9fc0a816ef444280eeabc84d.jpg)CoffeScript to reduce the code and make it more elegant.  

![bash terminal logo](/media/portfolio/2018-12-20---856/bash.png)A shell script compiles the LESS files, gathers and minimizes the scripts, checks the syntax, then compresses them into gzip, copies the files to the server, etc. This allows the application to be compiled in production mode with a simple command.  

iScroll.js to get the "native feel" on long lists.

energize.js to make the application more responsive by removing the 300 ms delay that allows a mobile browser to know whether it is a click or a double click. \[/av\_textblock\]
